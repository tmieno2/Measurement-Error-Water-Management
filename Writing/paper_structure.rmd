# Results

## ME in water use estiamtes based on energy

## Quota  

Energy quota relative to water quota

+ uniform allocation for both energy and water

Things to look at:

+ Economic loss (gain) using 
+ Water use slack

Comparative statics wrt 

+ the variance of the measurement error
+ heterogeneity of production function

## Trading

+ Trading reduces profit loss
+ Reduces uncertainty in water use

Measurement error is absorbed.

## Incentive to improve energy use efficiency

+ Energy use looks the same! Trouble for the administrator.
+ But, water use has gone up

## Fairness
